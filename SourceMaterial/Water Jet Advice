Subject: Waterjet & Laser Cut Vendor Info

Hi Brian, it was great seeing you and Debi!
 
Further to the conversation about the planer parts, I think that 1/4" thick straddles the boundary between laser and waterjet cutting.  I think laser offers you better edge finish, but you may have to go to waterjet due to thickness.  One other note is that there will likely be a $50-100 one time setup charge for the fabricator to load up the .dxf file and setup the job.
 
Anyhow, contact info for some local vendors that I have worked with below:
